# Installation

Get GraphQL Zeus up and running in your project in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Zeus, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 16.0 or higher
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** package manager
- A GraphQL API endpoint or schema file

## Installation Methods

### Using npm

```bash
npm install graphql-zeus
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add graphql-zeus
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add graphql-zeus
```

## Verify Installation

Check that Zeus is installed correctly:

```bash
npx zeus --version
```

You should see the version number printed to your console.

## Next Steps

Now that Zeus is installed, you can:

1. **[Generate your first client](/getting-started/quick-start)** - Learn how to generate type-safe GraphQL clients
2. **[Explore CLI options](/getting-started/cli-usage)** - Understand all available CLI commands and flags
3. **[Make your first query](/getting-started/first-query)** - Start querying your GraphQL API

## Project Setup Checklist

- [ ] Node.js 16+ installed
- [ ] GraphQL Zeus package installed
- [ ] GraphQL API endpoint accessible
- [ ] Output directory chosen for generated files

## Global Installation (Optional)

For convenience, you can install Zeus globally:

```bash
npm install -g graphql-zeus
```

This allows you to use `zeus` directly instead of `npx zeus`:

```bash
zeus https://your-api.com/graphql ./src
```

## Development vs Production

Zeus is typically used as a **development dependency** since it generates code at build time:

```bash
npm install --save-dev graphql-zeus
```

The generated client code has **zero runtime dependencies** on Zeus, making your production bundle lightweight.

## TypeScript Support

Zeus is built with TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

## Requirements Summary

| Requirement | Minimum Version     |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Node.js     | 16.0.0              |
| TypeScript  | 4.5.0 (recommended) |
| GraphQL     | Any version         |

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation:

```bash
# Use npm with --legacy-peer-deps flag
npm install graphql-zeus --legacy-peer-deps

# Or use sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm install -g graphql-zeus
```

### Network Issues

If you're behind a corporate proxy:

```bash
# Configure npm proxy
npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
```

### Version Conflicts

Check for conflicting GraphQL versions:

```bash
npm ls graphql
```

Zeus works with any GraphQL schema, but ensure you have compatible versions in your project.

## What Gets Installed

Zeus installation includes:

- **CLI tool** - Code generation command `zeus`
- **Core library** - Type generation engine
- **Templates** - Generated client templates

The generated code will include:

- Type-safe query builders
- GraphQL type definitions
- Helper utilities
- Subscription clients (if needed)

## Ready to Generate

With Zeus installed, you're ready to generate your first type-safe GraphQL client!
